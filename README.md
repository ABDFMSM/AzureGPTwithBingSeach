# AzureGPTwithBingSeach
In this repo I will be using Azure OpenAI and Bing Search to somehow let Azure GPT get their information from the internet. 

* [Bing Web Search API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/search-apis/bing-web-search/overview) used to return webpages related to the query. 
* [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) used with the page content to provide an answer to the questio. 

# Table of contents:

# Step 1 - Getting a URL from the Bing Web Search API
